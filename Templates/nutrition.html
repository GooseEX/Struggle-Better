  <h1>Stress</h1>
  <h2>Here are 10 tips on how you can deal with stress in college.</h2>
  <ol>
    <li id="stress_tip1"><b>Get Enough Sleep</b></li>
      <p id="stress_tip1P">It may be tempting to hit the hay at 4 a.m. and then attend an 8 a.m. class, but shortchanging yourself on rest can increase your stress level.
        Plus, insufficient sleep can put you at risk for serious illnesses, such as diabetes, obesity, and depression. Adults typically need seven to nine hours of sleep a night for best health.</p>
    <li id="stress_tip2"><b>Eat Well</b></li>
      <p id="stress_tip2P">A steady diet of pizza and vending-machine fare can decrease energy levels in the body, leading to a lower threshold for stress.
        Follow a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</p>
    <li id="stress_tip3"><b>Exercise</b></li>
      <p id="stress_tip3P">When you’re stressed, moving around may be the last thing you feel like doing. But as little as 20 minutes a day of physical activity can reduce stress levels.
        As for what type of exercise, try something that you enjoy doing, like swimming or yoga.</p>
    <li id="stress_tip4"><b>Avoid unnatural energy boosters</b></li>
      <p id="stress_tip4P">Artificial stimulants like caffeine pills or prescription meds may help you stay awake for that all-night study session, but putting off your body’s need to
         sleep will ultimately result in an energy crash, resulting again in a greater susceptibility to stress.</p>
    <li id="stress_tip5"><b>Get emotional support</b></li>
      <p id="stress_tip5P">Adjusting to college can be difficult, and venting your frustrations to a trusted friend can go a long way in fighting stress.
        Choose a friend or family member who won’t be judgmental or try to give lots of advice. Or seek the help of a professional counselor or psychologist.
        To find a trusted practitioner, check with your student health center for recommendations.</p>
    <li id="stress_tip6"><b>Don't give up your passions</b></li>
      <p id="stress_tip6P">Your schedule may be filled with lectures and study groups, but try to find at least a couple of hours each week to pursue a hobby or other activity that you enjoy.</p>
    <li id="stress_tip7"><b>Try not to overload yourself</b></li>
    <li id="stress_tip8"><b>Avoid relaxing with alcohol</b></li>
    <li id="stress_tip9"><b>Breathe</b></li>
    <li id="stress_tip10"><b>Get a massage</b></li>
  </ol>
